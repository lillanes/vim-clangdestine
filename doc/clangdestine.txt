SUMMARY                                                         *clangdestine*

This plugin automatically generates 'cinoptions' based on the values available
on a Clang format style file. The plugin searches for the file upwards through
the file hierarchy, starting in the same directory as the file being edited.

SETTINGS                                               *clangdestine-settings*

An alternative clang format file can be selected with:
>
  let g:clangdestine_format_file = `/path/to/file`
<
or:
>
  let b:clangdestine_format_file = `/path/to/file`
